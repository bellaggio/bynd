# Environment setup

This assessment environment set up is based on Docker-Symfony-Stack credit to [thomasd.codes](https://gitlab.com/thomasd.codes/docker-symfony-stack) aiming to provide a quick local symfony setup. However, it is a reference only, you may want to setup it your own way.

## Environment setup instruction
Copy the .env.example file and edit the entries to your needs:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Only start docker-compose to start your environment:
```
make up
```

After booting the container, you can use composer and the symfony cli insight the php-apache container:
```
docker exec -it symfony-assessment-apache-php bash
composer install
```

# üîÆ Beyond PHP Symfony Backend Assessment

## üìö Background

Imagine a fictional client "Global Books Inc" has asked us to build an API,
which can be used to manage their book inventory. 

- **GBI-001** Build model **publisher** which has the publisher name
- **GBI-002** Build model **author** which has the author name
- **GBI-003** Build model **book** which has the name, publisher, description 
  ISBN and author
- **GBI-004** Create an endpoint which allow to create / update books in the 
  book inventory
- **GBI-005** Create an endpoint which allow searching for books by their name

> **TIP** Don't forget to include these ticket numbers in your commit(s).
  Demostrate the usage of Unit Test and Dependency Injection will be apprecated.

## üìã Tasks

As described above, you've been assigned five tasks for a fictional project.

follow to build and deliver high-quality work at Beyond.

Below is a detailed description of the tasks, once your tasks are complete you
may proceed to the section below.

- üî≤ Add a check when creating or updating a **book** to ensure that the
  provided `author_id` and/or `publisher_id` exists and return a `404` error if they
  don't. Remember to adjust the unit test suite as necessary.
- üî≤ Add a `/search` endpoint to `/api/v1/books` so that a search can be
  performed for books based on their `name`.

> **TIP** We'll be looking at the following when reviewing your submission;
> test coverage, code standards, complexity, documentation and Git usage. If
> you're called for an interview, we'll reserve some time to discuss your
> submission. Think about the challenges you faced, your approach and
